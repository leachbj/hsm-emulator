[hsmsim](http://github.com/leachbj/hsmsim) is a simple HSM simulator providing a number of commands compatible
with a Thales 8000/9000 HSM.  The simulator only supports a small number of commands and can only use test LMKs
so should not be considered a replacement for a real HSM however it may be useful during a development of software
that interacts with a HSM.

## Quick start

The simulator runs as a java process

  java -jar hsmsim.jar

## Contributing

The simulator supports a very small number of commands and only supports the test LMKs.  Contributions of
additional command support welcomed.
